Found out that if using ./ paths, there will be problems with urls like localhost/qwe/asd -- the assets will be downloaded from /qwe/assets, which is wrong -> we need to use just '/' instead of './'.
The downside of this is that locally for development i will need to set up webserver rather than simply relying on the path of index.html itself.

- html fz for rems to work properly
- btn display-block to prevent situations when i apply .btn on label, and wonder wtf happened with width (bc label is inline, not inline-block)

Reasoning for putting js into assets: it's just more convenient project structure wise. And historically wise.
Yes, it may require some business-logic (like fetches), but it is still
an *asset* to the site.
